# ✅ Final Explanation & Fix

## Why You See "localhost" (Not Your Fault!)

### The Confusion:
You're using a **mobile APK**, but Firebase redirects mention "localhost". Here's why:

### What's Actually Happening:

1. **Your App's Origin:**
   - In Capacitor native apps: `capacitor://localhost`
   - This is YOUR APP, not a web server!

2. **Firebase Redirect:**
   - Firebase `signInWithRedirect()` redirects to `window.location.origin`
   - In your app, that's `capacitor://localhost` (the app itself!)
   - NOT `http://localhost` (that's for web browsers only)

3. **Why It Gets Stuck:**
   - If `capacitor://localhost` is NOT in Firebase Authorized Domains
   - Firebase can't redirect there
   - It might show `http://localhost` as a fallback (which doesn't work)

### The Real Fix:

**Add `capacitor://localhost` to Firebase Authorized Domains!**

1. Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains
2. Add: `capacitor://localhost`
3. Save

### How It Works After Fix:

1. Click "Sign-in with Google"
2. WebView navigates to Google sign-in
3. User signs in
4. Firebase redirects to `capacitor://localhost` (your app!)
5. WebView receives redirect
6. `handleGoogleRedirect()` processes it
7. Dashboard opens ✅

### Code Is Correct!

The code uses `signInWithRedirect()` which redirects to `window.location.origin` (your app). You just need to authorize it in Firebase!
