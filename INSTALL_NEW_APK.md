✅ **Improved Google Sign-In flow**
- Opens in external Chrome browser (not in-app WebView)
- Bypasses WebView redirect issues
- No need to add capacitor://localhost to Firebase

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Transfer APK to Your Phone
- Use USB cable, email, cloud storage, or ADB
- Example with ADB:
  ```bash
  adb install -r "C:\Users\coolb\Cursor Projects\android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk"
  ```

### 2. Install on Phone
- Tap the APK file
- Allow installation from this source if prompted
- Click "Install"
- This will replace the old version

### 3. Test Google Sign-In
1. Open the app
2. Click "Sign-in with Google" button
3. **Expected:** Chrome browser opens (external, not in-app)
4. **You should see:** Google account selection page
5. Select your Google account
6. Complete sign-in
7. **After sign-in:** Manually switch back to your app using app switcher
8. App should process the sign-in and navigate to dashboard

## What You Should See (Expected Behavior)

### ✅ SUCCESS:
- Chrome opens when you click the button
- Google sign-in page appears in Chrome
- You can select your account
- After sign-in, you manually return to app
- App recognizes you're signed in

### ❌ If You Still See Errors:

Check console logs (if you have remote debugging enabled):
- `✅ Browser plugin loaded successfully` - Plugin is working
- `✅ External browser (Chrome) opened successfully` - Chrome opened
- `❌ Browser plugin not available` - Plugin loading failed (shouldn't happen now)

## Why the Previous APK Didn't Work

The error you saw: **"Browser plugin not available"**

**Cause:**
1. The old APK was built BEFORE we synced the plugin
2. Even though the plugin was installed in package.json
3. It wasn't synced to Android (`npx cap sync android`)
4. So the native code didn't include the plugin

**Fix:**
1. We synced the plugin: `npx cap sync android`
2. Rebuilt the APK: `./gradlew clean assembleDebug`
3. The new APK includes the Browser plugin native code

## Troubleshooting

If Chrome doesn't open:
1. Check if Chrome is installed on your device
2. Enable remote debugging to see console logs
3. The enhanced logging will show which method failed

If you see storage errors after sign-in:
- This is expected for some browser privacy settings
- The app will provide alternative instructions

## Next Steps After Testing

Once you confirm the external browser opens:
- The deep link redirect can be improved (optional)
- Right now you manually return to app
- Can be enhanced for automatic return (requires Firebase configuration)

**This APK should fix the "Browser plugin not available" error.**

Install it and test. The plugin is now included!
